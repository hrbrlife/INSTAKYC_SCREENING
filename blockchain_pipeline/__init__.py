"""Utilities for orchestrating the GraphSense blockchain ETL pipeline.

The module provides a Prefect-based flow definition (when Prefect is available)
plus helper routines that render cron schedules for environments where a full
Prefect deployment is not feasible. See ``docs/blockchain_strategy.md`` for the
architecture overview.
